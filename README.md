# Developing Mule Applications for Performance

This course is for developers and architects who want to get hands-on experience developing highly available, reliable, and/or performant Mule applications.
Note: Prior experience equivalent to that covered in Anypoint Platform Development: Fundamentals or MuleSoft.U Development Fundamentals is required.
Students will:
- Develop scalable applications to achieve high availability.
- Build reliable applications using transactions and/or object stores.
- Develop highly performant applications that are optimized for high throughput and/or low latency.
- Tune applications for performance.
